/* This file is part of an open source library for electronic structure calculations.
 *  It contains a templated implementation of a retraction on the Stiefel manifold
 *  based on the Cayley transform (alternatively on the (1,1) Pade approximation of
 *  of the exponential. The classes passed as parameters are assumed to represent
 *  points on the manifold and tangent vectors. 
 *  
 *  As such, instances of these classes must essentitally be matrices, 
 *  supporting linear algebra operations, including solving linear systems.
